## Blinking an LED
hello.pru.c blinks an LED through the ARM GPIO structure.

## PWM Generator
pwm1.pru0.c toggles an LED using the PRU.

## Controlling the PWM Frequency
pwm4.pru0.c will toggle 4 different channels.

## Reading an Input at Regular Intervals
input.pru0.c reads an input pin and writes it to an output pin.

## Analog Wave Generator
sine.pru0.c is used to output an analog signal using the GPIO pins.
