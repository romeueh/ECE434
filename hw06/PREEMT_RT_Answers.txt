1. Where does Julia Cartwright work? 
Julia Cartwright works at National Instruments.

2. What is PREEMT_RT? 
PREEMT_RT is a patch for Linus that makes it into a real-time system.

3. What is mixed criticality? 
Mixed Criticality is when there are two degrees of time sensitivity where one is critial and one isn't.

4. How can drivers misbehave? 
Drivers can misbehave by prioritizing non RT tasks when the driver stacks are shared between RT tasks and non-RT tasks.

5. What is Δ in Figure 1? 
In Figure 1, Δ is the time between an event is triggered vs it's execution.

6. What is Cyclictest[2]? 
Take a time stamp, sleep for a fixed duration and then sleep for a fixed duration. The difference between the two timestamps with the duration subtracted out is the delta mentioned above.

7. What is plotted in Figure 2? 
Figure 2 plotted a histogram comparing the Cyclictest being performed on an OS with vs. without the PREEMT_RT patch.

8. What is dispatch latency? Scheduling latency? 
Dispatch latency refers to the amount of time it takes between the interrupt occurring and the thread scheduling being told something needs to run. 
Scheduling latency refers to time it tasks from the scheduler running to the CPU being given the task to execute.

9. What is mainline?
Mainline is the tree where all new features are introduce d and developed 

10. What is keeping the External event in Figure 3 from starting? 
The execution of the low priority interrupt  is keeping the External event in Figure 3 from starting.

11. Why can the External event in Figure 4 start sooner? 
The External event in Figure 4 can start sooner because when using the PREEMT RT patch only a very small amount of time has to be spent waking up the threads. They can also now be preempted, reducing the irq_dispatch latency.
